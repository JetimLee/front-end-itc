//--Summary:
//  Create a program to read a list of numbers from multiple files,
//  sum the total of each file, then sum all the totals.
//
//--Requirements:
//* Sum the numbers in each file noted in the main() function
//* Add each sum together to get a grand total for all files
//  - Print the grand total to the terminal
//* Launch a goroutine for each file
//* Report any errors to the terminal
//
//--Notes:
//* This program will need to be ran from the `lectures/exercise/goroutines`
//  directory:
//    cd lectures/exercise/goroutines
//    go run goroutines
//* The grand total for the files is 4103109
//* The data files intentionally contain invalid entries
//* stdlib packages that will come in handy:
//  - strconv: parse the numbers into integers
//  - bufio: read each line in a file
//  - os: open files
//  - io: io.EOF will indicate the end of a file
//  - time: pause the program to wait for the goroutines to finish

	files := []string{"num1.txt", "num2.txt", "num3.txt", "num4.txt", "num5.txt"}
